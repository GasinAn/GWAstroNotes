  abstract     = {Gravitational wave detectors are already operating at interesting         sensitivity levels, and they have an upgrade path that should         result in secure detections by 2014. We review the physics of         gravitational waves, how they interact with detectors (bars and         interferometers), and how these detectors operate. We study the         most likely sources of gravitational waves and review the data         analysis methods that are used to extract their signals from         detector noise. Then we consider the consequences of         gravitational wave detections and observations for physics,         astrophysics, and cosmology.},

  abstract  = {There is a non-linear and covariant electromagnetic analogy for gravity,         in which the full Bianchi identities are Maxwell-type equations         for the free gravitational field, encoded in the Weyl tensor.         This tensor gravito-electromagnetism is based on a covariant         generalization of spatial vector algebra and calculus to spatial         tensor fields, and includes all non-linear effects from the         gravitational field and matter sources. The non-linear vacuum         Bianchi equations are invariant under spatial duality rotation         of the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic tensor fields. The         super-energy density and super-Poynting vector of the         gravitational field are natural duality invariants, and satisfy         a super-energy conservation equation.},
