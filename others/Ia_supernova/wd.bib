We review the physics of         gravitational waves, how they interact with detectors (bars and         interferometers), and how these detectors operate. We study the         most likely sources of gravitational waves and review the data         analysis methods that are used to extract their signals from         detector noise. Then we consider the consequences of         gravitational wave detections and observations for physics,         astrophysics, and cosmology.},

  abstract  = {Merging compact binaries are currently regarded as the most promising         source of gravitational waves for the planned Earth-based         LIGO/VIRGO laser-interferometer detector system, and will be an         important source also for similar, lower-frequency detectors         that might be flown in space (e.g., the proposed LISA mission).         During the orbital inspiral, if one or both bodies are rapidly         rotating, the general relativistic spin-orbit and spin-spin         coupling (i.e., the ``dragging of inertial frames`` by the         bodies' spins) cause the binary's orbital plane to process. In         this paper we analyze the resulting modulation of the inspiral         gravitational waveform, using post$^{2}$-Newtonian equations to         describe the precession of the orbital plane, but only the         leading-order (Newtonian, quadrupole-moment approximation)         equations to describe the orbit, the radiation reaction, the         inspiral, and the wave generation. We derive all the formulas         one needs to readily compute the spin-modulated gravitational         waveform (within the post-Newtonian approximation and the         approximation that the precession frequency is much smaller than         the orbital frequency). We also develop intuition into what the         modulated signals ``look like,'' by a variety of means. We         provide approximate, analytical solutions for the precessional         motion and the modulated waveforms for two important special         cases: the case where the bodies have nearly equal masses and         the case where one of the bodies has negligible spin. For these         cases, for almost all choices of binary parameters, the motion         is a simple precession of the orbital angular momentum around         the nearly fixed direction of the total angular momentum, with a         few tens of precession periods as the waves sweep through the         LIGO/VIRGO observational band. However, when the spin and         orbital angular momenta are approximately antialigned, there is         a transitional-precession epoch during which their near         cancellation causes the binary to ``lose its gyroscopic         bearings'' and tumble in space, with a corresponding peculiar         sweep of the waveform modulation. We also explore numerically         the precessional behaviors that occur for general masses and         spins; these typically appear quite similar to our special-case,         simple-precession, and transitional-precession solutions. An         Appendix develops several diagrammatic aids for understanding         intuitively the relation between the precessing orbit and the         modulated waveform.},

The experiment relies on a constellation of three drag-free spacecraft orbiting the Earth. Inter-spacecraft laser interferometry is used to monitor the distances between the test masses. The experiment is designed to be capable of detecting a signal with high confidence from a single source of gravitational waves within a few months of observing time. We describe the preliminary mission concept for TianQin, including the candidate source and experimental designs. We present estimates for the major constituents of the experiment’s error budget and discuss the project’s overall feasibility. Given the current level of technological readiness, we expect TianQin to be flown in the second half of the next decade.},

  abstract      = {We calculate the angular resolution of the planned LISA detector, a         space-based laser interferometer for measuring low-frequency         gravitational waves from galactic and extragalactic sources.         LISA is not a pointed instrument; it is an all-sky monitor with         a quadrupolar beam pattern. LISA will measure simultaneously         both polarization components of incoming gravitational waves, so         the data will consist of two time series. All physical         properties of the source, including its position, must be         extracted from these time series. LISA's angular resolution is         therefore not a fixed quantity, but rather depends on the type         of signal and on how much other information must be extracted.         Information about the source position will be encoded in the         measured signal in three ways: (1) through the relative         amplitudes and phases of the two polarization components, (2)         through the periodic Doppler shift imposed on the signal by the         detector's motion around the Sun, and (3) through the further         modulation of the signal caused by the detector's time-varying         orientation. We derive the basic formulas required to calculate         the LISA's angular resolution         {\ensuremath{\Delta}}{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{S}$ for a given         source. We then evaluate         {\ensuremath{\Delta}}{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{S}$ for two sources         of particular interest: monchromatic sources and mergers of         supermassive black holes. For these two types of sources, we         calculate (in the high signal-to-noise approximation) the full         variance-covariance matrix, which gives the accuracy to which         all source parameters can be measured. Since our results on         LISA's angular resolution depend mainly on gross features of the         detector geometry, orbit, and noise curve, we expect these         results to be fairly insensitive to modest changes in detector         design that may occur between now and launch. We also expect         that our calculations could be easily modified to apply to a         modified design.},
