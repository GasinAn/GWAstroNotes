  abstract  = {The objectives of the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (DECIGO) are to open a new window of observation for gravitational wave astronomy and to obtain insight into significant areas of science, such as verifying and characterizing inflation, determining the thermal history of the universe, characterizing dark energy, describing the formation mechanism of supermassive black holes in the center of galaxies, testing alternative theories of gravity, seeking black hole dark matter, understanding the physics of neutron stars and searching for planets around double neutron stars. DECIGO consists of four clusters of spacecraft in heliocentric orbits; each cluster employs three drag-free spacecraft, 1000 km apart from each other, whose relative displacements are measured by three pairs of differential Fabry‚ÄìPerot Michelson interferometers. Two milestone missions, DECIGO pathfinder and Pre-DECIGO, will be launched to demonstrate required technologies and possibly to detect gravitational waves.},

  abstract  = {Monitoring of vibrational eigenmodes of an elastic body excited by gravitational waves was one of the first concepts proposed for the detection of gravitational waves. At laboratory scale, these experiments became known as resonant bar detectors first developed by Joseph Weber in the 1960s. Due to the dimensions of these bars, the targeted signal frequencies were in the kHz range. Weber also pointed out that monitoring of vibrations of Earth or the Moon could reveal gravitational waves in the mHz band. His Lunar Surface Gravimeter experiment deployed on the Moon by the Apollo 17 crew had a technical failure, which greatly reduced the science scope of the experiment. In this article, we revisit the idea and propose a Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA). We find that LGWA could become an important partner observatory for joint observations with the space-borne, laser-interferometric detector LISA and at the same time contribute an independent science case due to LGWA‚Äôs unique features. Technical challenges need to be overcome for the deployment of the experiment, and development of inertial vibration sensor technology lays out a future path for this exciting detector concept.},

  abstract  = {Several large-scale experimental facilities and space-missions are being suggested to probe the universe across the spectrum. Here we propose - the first concept design in the NASA Artemis era for a GW observatory on the Moon. Using feasible interferometer technologies, we find that a lunar-based observatory is ideal for probing frequencies in the range between deci-Hz to 5 Hz, an astrophysically rich regime that is very challenging for both Earth- and space-based detectors. GLOC can survey binaries with neutron stars, stellar and intermediate-mass black holes to ‚â≥ 70% of the observable volume of our universe without significant background contamination. The sensitivity at ùí™(1¬†Hz) allows a unique window into calibrating Type Ia supernovae. At its ultimate sensitivity limits, GLOC would trace the Hubble expansion rate up to redshift z ‚àº 3 and test General Relativity and ŒõCDM cosmology up to z‚àº 350.},

  abstract  = {Gravitational wave astronomy has now left its infancy and has become an important tool for probing the most violent phenomena in our Universe. The LIGO/Virgo-KAGRA collaboration operates ground based detectors which cover the frequency band from 10¬†Hz to the kHz regime. Meanwhile, the pulsar timing array and the soon to launch LISA mission will cover frequencies below 0.1¬†Hz, leaving a gap in detectable gravitational wave frequencies. Here we show how a laser interferometer on the moon (LION) gravitational wave detector would be sensitive to frequencies from sub Hz to kHz. We find that the sensitivity curve is such that LION can measure compact binaries with masses between 10 and 100M ‚äô at cosmological distances, with redshifts as high as z = 100 and beyond, depending on the spin and the mass ratio of the binaries. LION can detect binaries of compact objects with higher-masses, with very large signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), help us to understand how supermassive black holes got their colossal masses on the cosmological landscape, and it can observe in detail intermediate-mass ratio inspirals at distances as large as at least 100¬†Gpc. Compact binaries that never reach the LIGO/Virgo sensitivity band can spend significant amounts of time in the LION band, while sources present in the LISA band can be picked up by the detector and observed until their final merger. Since LION covers the deci-Hertz regime with such large SNRs, it truly achieves the dream of multi messenger astronomy.},
