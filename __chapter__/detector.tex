\section{TT frame}

TT gauge $\Rightarrow$ TT frame.

If a test mass is at rest at $\tau=0$ ($\Rightarrow \d x^i/\d\tau=0$), $\d x^\mu/\d\tau=0$, $\d^2 x^i/\d\tau^2=0$. In the TT frame, particles which were at rest before the arrival of the wave remain at rest even after the arrival ofthe wave.

two test masses, proper position $s_i$, $\ddot{s}_i=(1/2)\ddot{h}_{ij}s_j$.
